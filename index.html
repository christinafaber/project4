      <strong>BLUE</strong>

      <strong>GRAPE</strong>
      <br>
      Grape is the youngest member of the Cuteness Creatures, and is quite shy. She knows her family loves her,
      but she still feels alone sometimes. Her older siblings help her out a lot, and for that she is very grateful.

      <strong>GHOST</strong>
      <br>
      One of the oldest members of the family, he is probably the creature that his members know the least about.
      He is quite mysterious and secretive, vanishing and reappearing without a word all the time.

    <strong>BLOBBY</strong>
      <br>
      A well known trait of Blobby's is that they can fall asleep anywhere, and for a long amount of time.
      Blobby is the hardest to wake from a slumber. Their members have started playing emergency vehicle noises in order to get them out of bed.

      <strong>WIND</strong>
      <br>
      The Cuteness Creatures are a loving and playful group for the most part; but Wind is the anchor that roots the rest of the members back to reality.
      An overwhelming realist, he has a hard time enjoying the simple things in life.

    <strong>PPANG</strong>
      <br>
      The member with the warmest personality would be Ppang! She is outgoing and extroverted, pairing very well with the
      shyer members of her family. She can talk to anyone for any amount of time about... well, anything!

    <div class="text">
      <strong>KIT</strong>
      <br>
      Similar to that of a cat, Kit is a playful creature who can sometimes be too much. She loves her family, but can show it in weird ways,
      like eating the last slice of pie or stealing a member's items. She is the member who receives the most snuggles.

    <strong>GREENIE</strong>
      <br>
      Regarded as the funniest member of the Cuteness Creatures, Greenie is known for playing harmless pranks and telling silly jokes to his family.
      He always comes up with something new. The members would argue that you've never heard him say the same joke twice.

      <strong>APPA</strong>
      <br>
        AKA the brains of the group. Appa has been in school the longest studying every subject under the sun. His brain is a sponge and he wants it filled with knowledge!
      His photographic memory allows him to remember every small fact, including endearing notes about his members.

      <strong>WILBUR</strong>
      <br>
      1/2 of the Twins in the Cuteness Creatures, Wilbur is known for being shy and loud, and they change between it very quickly. 
      In a matter of seconds Wilbur can go from being the loudest person in the room to the quietest.

      <strong>WINSTON</strong>
      <br>
      1/2 of the Twins in the Cuteness Creatures, like their twin Wilbur, Winston is known for being extremely loud or quiet.
      They must have twins telepathy because whenever Winston is loud and outgoing, Wilbur is shy and soft-spoken. They seem to trade off the roles almost
      perfectly.
